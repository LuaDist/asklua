<h1><em>asklua</em>: adding interactive help to other modules</h1>


<p><strong>Julio Manuel Fernández-Díaz</strong></p>

<p><em>Profesor Titular,
Department of Physics, University of Oviedo (Spain),
February 2010</em></p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We present <code>AskLua</code>, a system for managing help: for on line use in
    the interactive interpreter, and for generating documentation in <code>html</code>
    and printed formats.</p>
    
    <p>Module <code>ask</code>, provided by <code>AskLua</code>, is little intrusive and, although
    it occupies some memory, it can be deleted by the user at any time if
    he/she does not want to continue with the help on line.</p>
    
    <p>The system is fairly integrated, in such a way that it is possible to
    easily add help for an existing module, even of binary type.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>When we learn a new subject it is suitable to have information, as
complete as possible, about the topic. Often this is achieved through an
expert (teacher).  Nevertheless, we have not always access to one. For
this it is necessary to be self-taught. In these occasions a good helping
system, as interactive as possible, is very interesting.</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.Matlab.com">Matlab</a>, for example, have interactive help on
line. This allows the beginners a comfortable access to the system during
the first phases of their learning.</p>

<p>Obviously tools like the mentioned languages will have more use 
with an easy access to the documentation. And this is very interesting
for designers of Lua modules.</p>

<p>Lua has a quite minimalist approach, almost opposite to two mentioned.
Therefore, it is practically a chimera the inclusion of a help system
in the standard.</p>

<p>Lua does not impose policies, but it is very extensible. This allows us
to easily include a system (module) of help, which is loaded if we wish.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate programming</a>, very aimed to the programmer, does not convince
me as a mechanism to solve our problem, since it is necessary to learn
another <em>pseudo-language</em> and it really serves for another thing.</p>

<p>The system of documentation that accompanies <code>stdlua</code> with <code>@param</code>,
<code>@returns</code>, etc., is not of my taste, since it consists of
comments in the code. This is nice for checking and studying Lua
code, but to obtain a system of documentation on line it is
relatively complex. In addition, the documentation is also aimed to
the programmer and not so much to the user of some module (for example,
an engineer who wants to use <a href="http://numlua.luaforge.net">Numlua</a>).</p>

<p>A system very similar to <code>stdlua</code>, though more advanced
is <a href="http://luadoc.luaforge.net">Luadoc</a>, which allows the creation of documentation in <code>html</code> format,
also starting from comments in the modules. The final format is friendly
enough for managing the documentation in a browser, but it does
not serve for on line help, which is what I initially wished.</p>

<p>In any case, both <code>stdlua</code> and Luadoc can be easily adapted
to our purposes (below explained): it is enough to integrate the
comments (by hand, before their use) in the corresponding help tables.</p>

<p>When I was ending this documentation I discovered in <a href="http://luarocks.org/repositories/rocks/">LuaRocks</a>
a module named <a href="http://code.google.com/p/luahelp/downloads/list">LuaHelp</a> (being December 13, 2009, the date of the
first version). Initially I thought that my work had been useless since
others have done the module that I was wishing.  (Anyhow, new things are
always learnt on programming.) I have to say that the announce of it in
<a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/">lua list</a> goes unnoticed to me.</p>

<p>Once analyzed the topic more deeply, I have realized the differences
(although <a href="http://code.google.com/p/luahelp/downloads/list">LuaHelp</a> might be adapted in many ways, obviously): the
documentation that I propose is included in the own module, whereas the
other one is included in auxiliary files placed in a concrete path.
In addition, the method here presented allows to consult separately
specific parts of the help: how a function in a module is used,
examples of use, the list of functions of a module, etc.  They are two
different approaches with its advantages and disadvantages (that the
user can verify).</p>

<p>The unique trouble is that we was compelled to change the name of my
module. Now its name is <code>ask</code> (and I had preferred <code>help</code>).  That way
they can use both modules simultaneously. Anyhow, if the user wishes to
rename <code>ask</code> and to call it <code>help</code> only renaming <code>ask.lua</code> to <code>help.lua</code>
is sufficient. In this case it is interesting to change the notices that
a module gives when loaded (see section 
<a href="#know">4.3 How we know that a module has help</a>).</p>

<p>Another specific possibility is to load module <code>ask</code>, by referencing it
with a variable <code>help</code> in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>local help = require "ask"
</code></pre>

<p>Et voilà. We can choose both <code>ask</code> and <code>help</code> for using the present module
(from this moment we cannot use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/luahelp/downloads/list">LuaHelp</a>, obviously).</p>



<h2>2 The problem</h2>

<p>It has two aspects:</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>On the one hand, for the <em>programmer</em> of a module who wants to add help.
    It will have to be easy to implement, with the minimal modifications
    to his/her module.</p></li>
    <li><p>On the other hand, for the module <em>users</em>. The browsing of the
    documentation will have to be as complete as possible but of easy managing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As programmers, we are interested in the ease of
adding documentation, as complete as possible. Also, if possible several
formats are welcome: </p>

<ul>
    <li>on line in interactive Lua,</li>
    <li>on line in a browser, which requires <code>html</code> format (although some
    others exist, <code>html</code> is a standard),</li>
    <li>printed format.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the programmer is very interested in introducing the
documentation only once, and the existence of an automatic system to
produce several formats is nearly a must. This avoids many mistakes and the
modifications, when necessary, have to be done only in one place.</p>

<p>From the user point of view, he/she will want that documentation is:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>easy</em> to access, giving only the required information (not more, nor less);</li>
    <li>the <em>most complete</em> possible, covering many aspects, even secondary in
    occasions;</li>
    <li><em>relational</em>, that is, it can allow us to go from one point to another in
    the documentation (if a relationship exists).</li>
</ul>


<p>After many thoughts, many tests, and designing several versions of the help
module, finally the system explained below arised.</p>


<h2>3 The solution</h2>

<p>The information of help in Lua can go only (more or less) in tables, with
strings, or in files (as in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/luahelp/downloads/list">LuaHelp</a>). It has seemed to me that
file managing would be cumbersome enough since files must be accessible and
possibly where the module resides. It would be
necessary to search in the <em>paths</em> of Lua and there might be more than one
file with the name for that we are looking for (and not to correspond the help to
what it is wished). Therefore I have preferred the other option.</p>

<p>Our module <code>ask</code> must be able to access to these tables (if they
exist, but throwing a warning if no available information about a certain
module exists), then giving the proper required information.</p>


<p>I will describe module <code>ask</code>.</p>


<h3>3.1 Where information is placed</h3>

<p>The first one is <em>where</em> is held the help information of a module.
In Lua it is obvious that a table is the right place, with possible
sub-tables, and finally text (strings). Besides, help for a module
(v.g., <code>mininum</code>, the example attached to <code>ask</code>) must be associated
to it in some way: Lua have to know the help like it knows about
module functions (otherwise it cannot "help" us).</p>

<p>The help must be sub-divided. The final idea consists of including in
the module (v.g., inside <code>module.lua</code>) a table <code>_H</code> with fields and
sub-tables. Here is the structure:</p>

<pre><code>_H = {
  _CHARSET = "iso-8985-15",   -- or typically "utf-8"
  _Name    = [[Name of the module]],

  _basic   = [[Basic help]],
  _usage   = [[Usage help]],
  _more    = [[Complementary information]],
  _seealso = [[Links to more information (internal or external)]],
  _example = [[An example of use]],
  _notes   = [[Notes (Copyright, etc.)]]
  _version = [[Version, name of the author and other subjects]],
}
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: <code>_Name</code> has a capital <code>"N"</code>.)</p>


<p><code>_CHARSET</code> identifies what encoding has been used in the texts of
help. For help in <code>html</code> format <code>ask</code> directly uses the value
in this field.</p>

<p>For on line help, <code>ask</code> detects the operating system character encoding to convert
from the set of characters indicated in <code>_CHARSET</code> to that
one of the system (this way help is correctly visualized on screen).
At the moment this system only is implemented with UFT-8 and iso-8859:
If <code>ask</code> does not detect UTF-8 then it thinks <code>iso-8859</code> is the enconding
in the operating system.</p>

<p>This table is included in any point of the file <code>module.lua</code> (although its
logical place is near the beginning). None of the fields is mandatory:
if the programmer does not gives an example the field <code>_example</code> is
not specified.</p>

<p>As we see, in order that the minimal interference exists with other
variables and functions of the module, I have put <code>"_"</code> in front of the
table name. In this way, we will avoid collisions of names: it is rare to
use names of this type (except for local variables). In any case, the user
of <code>ask</code> can change in the source code <code>_H</code> into another name with a text
editor (since the source code is provided) and to perform accordingly.</p>

<p>Every function of the module (v.g., <code>about</code>, <code>base</code> and <code>doc</code>
in the module <code>ask</code>) can have its associate help.  For example, for the
first function, it is:</p>

<pre><code>_H.about = {
  _basic   = [[Basic help]],
  _usage   = [[Usage help]],
  _more    = [[Complementary information]],
  _seealso = [[Links to more information (internal or external)]],
  _example = [[An example of use]],
}
</code></pre>

<p>In some cases we have tables of functions. For example, if <code>tabfun</code>
is a table with functions, namely <code>f1</code> y <code>f2</code>, we could put:</p>

<pre><code>_H.tabfun = { ... }

_H.tabfun.f1 = {
  _basic   = [[ ... ]],
  _usage   = [[ ... ]],
  _example = [[ ... ]],
}

_H.tabfun.f2 = { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously if no information exists about some function, then we do not
have to specify it (as <code>_more</code> and <code>_seealso</code> in previous <code>f1</code>).</p>

<p>Initially the format of the string going between <code>[[ ]]</code> was pure
text. With it, for the help on line it is enough. Nevertheless, it was
my desire that the information can also be printed. Then, a more
advanced format is better. It leaded me to the format <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a>,
which in addition has an implementation in pure Lua, <a href="http://www.frykholm.se/programming.html">markdown.lua</a>,
done by Niklas Frykholm. (Note: the version appearing in <a href="http://luaforge.net">luaforge.net</a>
is obsolete, but the one in <a href="http://luarocks.org/repositories/rocks/">Luarocks</a> is correct.)
Actually, this document has been prepared in markdown format.</p>

<p>This format is not much intrusive. This is important because I did not
want to filter help on line, but I wanted it untouched in the strings
of help.</p>


<h3>3.2 How information is accessed</h3>

<p>We have already the information in <em>its</em> place (Lua tables).  When the
module is loaded also these tables are. Then, from this moment they
are accessible (evidently they occupy space; in
<a href="#howto">5 How to use the help interactively</a>
we will see how to free it if wished).</p>

<p>Now we must talk about <em>how</em> to access the information.
For that, <code>ask</code> has three functions: <code>about</code>, <code>base</code> and <code>doc</code>.</p>


<h4>| about |</h4>

<p>This was also the first one in being designed: it provides the
information on line. It is necessary to tell it <em>about</em> we want help
and <em>which</em> of the diverse information piceces we wish (for example
<code>basic</code>, for the basic information). Function <code>about</code> would be invoked,
for example:</p>

<pre><code>ask.about"/mininum.root^basic"
</code></pre>

<p>being <code>mininum</code> the name of the module, <code>root</code> the name of one of the
functions inside the module, and <code>basic</code> the type of information we wish
(I will explain below the inclusion of the initial <code>"/"</code>).
A caret <code>"^"</code> separates what we wish from the type of information
we want.</p>

<p>In another example we would have:</p>

<pre><code>ask.about"/somemod.tabfun.f1^usage"
</code></pre>

<p>that is, we ask for <code>usage</code> help of the function <code>f1</code> inside the table
<code>tabfun</code> of the module <code>somemod</code>.</p>

<p>Another important information for the user exists: the list of functions
inside the module. The designer of the module has not to introduce it
because <code>ask</code> obtains this directly. For displaying it in
screen we have to use:</p>

<pre><code>ask.about"/mininum^list"
</code></pre>


<p>Also it is possible to ask for all the information that exists about
something, by means of:</p>

<pre><code>ask.about"/mininum.root^all"
</code></pre>

<p>As we see, the user in this basic format of invocation of <code>about</code> has to
type much.  The following thing that I did was to admit abbreviations for
the information type:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>b</code> instead of <code>basic</code>, that provides basic information;</li>
    <li><code>e</code> instead of <code>example</code>, that shows us an example;</li>
    <li><code>l</code> instead of <code>list</code>, that shows a list of functions in the module
    (or in a table of functions);</li>
    <li><code>m</code> instead of <code>more</code>, that shows additional information;</li>
    <li><code>s</code> instead of <code>seealso</code>, that cites us links to more information
    (external or internal);</li>
    <li><code>u</code> instead of <code>usage</code>, that shows us how to use the module or function;</li>
    <li><code>v</code> instead of <code>version</code>, that shows us version information, name of the
    authors, etc.</li>
    <li><code>n</code> instead of <code>notes</code>, that shows us notes as the Copyright, etc.</li>
    <li><code>a</code> instead of <code>all</code>, that provides all the previous information.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this way we have the equivalence:</p>

<pre><code>ask.about"/mininum^list"  --&gt;&lt;--  ask.about"/mininum^l"
</code></pre>

<p>The spaces typed in the argument of <code>ask.about</code> are removed before
the search. Also <code>about</code> collapses multiple <code>"."</code> that could appear in the
searching string. For example, we would have the equivalence:</p>

<pre><code>ask.about "/ mininum . root ^ usage" --&gt;&lt;-- ask.about"/mininum.root^u"
</code></pre>

<p>When information is not provided, by default it is supposed <code>basic</code>.</p>

<p>By using <code>nil</code> as argument of <code>ask.about</code> we obtain basic information
about the help system. Then,</p>

<pre><code>ask.about()  --&gt;&lt;--  ask.about("/ask^basic")
</code></pre>

<p>are equivalent.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remember that <code>ask</code> provides the information the
designer of the module has included in the proper help tables (except for
<code>list</code> and <code>all</code>, obviously). That is, the information might be
incorrect, for example, if data about the version is included in <code>_more</code>.</p>


<h4>| base |</h4>

<p>The reader can see we have still to type very much.
Normally when one works with a module (let's say <a href="http://numlua.luaforge.net">Numlua</a>)
we need help in an implicit way for it (and not for other module).
For it, I have included the function <code>ask.base</code>.
This function allows to implicitly assume an information searching prefix.
For example, by putting:</p>

<pre><code>ask.base"mininum"
--&gt;  Changing help basis to "mininum"
</code></pre>

<p>from this moment the prefix <code>"/mininum"</code> is added to the search path
(sometimes with an added point <code>"."</code>, when referring to a module or to
a table of functions inside the module and we wish information about an
specific function). Then, these are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>ask.about"/mininum^list"  --&gt;&lt;--  ask.about"^l"
</code></pre>

<p>I have called this prefix <code>basis</code> (stored in a local variable).</p>

<p>Invoking <code>ask.base</code> using as parameter an empty string <code>""</code>, it
shows us the current <code>basis</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ask.base""  
--&gt;   Help basis is "mininum"
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, there has seemed suitable to me that:</p>

<pre><code>ask.base(nil)
</code></pre>

<p>changes <code>basis</code> to <code>"ask"</code>.</p>

<p>The on line help system is already operative, but I liked no much the
necessity of writing <code>ask.about</code> whenever I wanted help (altough, as read
<code>ask.about"/mininum.root^usage"</code> is nearly equivalent to <em>ask about
mininum.root usage</em>).  The solution was to include the chunk of code:</p>

<pre><code>__call = function (t, s, ...)
   if s == nil then
      about(nil)
   elseif type(s) == "string" then
      about(s)
   else
      return t[s](...)
   end
end

setmetatable(_G.ask, ask)
</code></pre>

<p>at the end of <code>ask.lua</code>. The last line allows us to use directly <code>ask</code> as
a global variable after doing <code>require "ask"</code>. The previous chunk of code
allows the function <code>about</code> is automatically invoked when <code>ask</code>
receives a string as argument. Then</p>

<pre><code>ask.about"/mininum.root^usage" --&gt;&lt;-- ask"root^u"
</code></pre>

<p>are equivalent (with <code>basis = "mininum"</code>).  The simplification is
manifest, and it is near impossible to type less when asking help.
Actually, slightly less we can type if the module <code>ask</code> is invoked in
the way: <code>h = require "ask"</code>; from this moment we can put <code>h"root^u"</code>.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that <code>ask</code> is not much writing, is more
descriptive, and it is possible that <code>h</code> has another use inside our
program.</p>


<h4>| doc |</h4>

<p>With the previous function I had already the module with the wished
functionality. But it is a pity to have the information only on line and
not to be able to print it on a decent format. Therefore, I have designed
the function <code>doc</code>. The first idea was to adapt a bit the text output. But
a bit more of expense when writing the help, using the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a>
format, allows us an output in <code>html</code> format suitable enough. It was
easy, since a module exists, <a href="http://www.frykholm.se/programming.html">markdown.lua</a> (that obviously must be
installed), which can be invoked from <code>ask</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>html</code> version of help is complementary to the on line one.
It allows a more <em>global</em> vision of a given module, surfing the
information by browsing among the different functions inside it.
Hence, it is interesting enough.</p>

<p>In this point system <code>ask</code> seems Luadoc: both generate <code>html</code>
format. Nevertheless, the starting points are very different.</p>

<p>It is also possible to obtain the help in printed format, printing from
a browser. Probably it is better to use a program like <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html">html2ps</a>
by Jan Kärrman, that generates a Postscript (PS) format (and then PDF,
also the latter with active hyperlinks).</p>

<p>The function <code>ask.doc</code> has been re-designed several times, and
I am still not much happy with the result (though it works
correctly, without being very elegant). It generates <code>html</code>.
In this case, partial information of functions is not needed inside a module.
Therefore, the generated <code>html</code> file contains all the information
corresponding to the module (for it, <code>basis</code> must contain the name of the
module and not of one of the functions inside).
For example:</p>

<pre><code>ask.doc""
</code></pre>

<p>would create <code>html</code> help for <code>basis</code> (v.g., <code>"mininum"</code> previously),
with the name <code>"mininum.html"</code>, and:</p>

<pre><code>ask.doc"ask"
</code></pre>

<p>would generate <code>html</code> help for <code>ask</code>.</p>


<p>The <code>html</code> file generated by <code>ask.doc</code> contains first generic information
about the module (the content of <code>_H._basic</code>, <code>_H._usage</code>, etc.), then
the help of all functions (in alphabetical order), to finish with 
<code>_H._version</code> and <code>_H._notes</code>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I apologize since my programming is a little "dirty" in some parts
of the module. My other occupations have not allowed me more time for
improving it, and as one of my professors (León Garzón) said "the <em>best</em>
is enemy of the <em>good</em>".</p>


<h2>4 How modules are adapted to add them help</h2>

<h3>4.1 Why markdown format</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a> format is simple enough in order that a module
programmer learns it in an hour. It is not necessary for
the help on line (even some people can think it is
something annoying). I believe that it does not introduce much
<em>noise</em> in the on line help, and nevertheless it allows a good
presentation in <code>html</code> (and in PDF after other conversions).</p>

<p>It is possible to look up in the indicated address, but there also
exists a two pages PDF document with a simple help of the
system <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/howtube/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet.pdf">Markdown Syntax Cheat Sheet</a> (the truth, it is necessary
little more than this simple help to learn <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a>).</p>

<p>Thinking a bit more about the help in <code>html</code> and printed formats we could
introduce even references to images. It is evident that in the on line help
(always text mode) it is impossible to visualize an image, but its
reference can be given in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a> format (not much
intrusive). It would be in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>![Alternative text](/path/to/image.jpg "Optional title")
</code></pre>

<p>(Instead of JPG format we can also use PNG or GIF.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">markdown</a> format also allows to show links to other documents
(internal or external ones) in a simple way. In the on line help this is
not relevant but in <code>html</code> format is. For example, <code>_seealso</code>
can be designed including links in the way:</p>

<pre><code>internal:          [label](#reference)

external:          [label](http://what.we.want)
</code></pre>


<h3>4.2 Preparing help data</h3>

<p>The general idea is simple: doing it in an incremental way.  A complete
documentation can be a long and tedious task.  Therefore, it would be
convenient to begin with <code>_basic</code> help, then <code>_usage</code>, since they are
both primary aspects. Since it is usual to put those as comments in
the head of functions, what we have to do is to convert the comments
already written in a piece of <code>_H</code>.</p>

<p>Later, other parts that still remain can be added. An example (commented
if wished) is convenient for the user could try it (even copying and
pasting code).</p>

<p>The logical place of introducing this information is before the
corresponding function (as usual), and in case of modules near the
beginning of the file.</p>

<p>If one wants to prepare the help for a compiled module we have to do
the following.</p>

<p>If the binary module is ours, and we can recompile it, we can internally
change the name of the table if we wish, renaming also the compiled
file. Then one creates a Lua source file, with the included help, with
the old name and extension <code>.lua</code>) that loads the compiled file.</p>

<p>A second possibility is to name in a different way the compiled module
and the one that we are going to load with <code>require</code>. For example,
we have a module compiled in binary format of name <code>mymodule.so</code> (or
<code>mymodule.dll</code>).  We will create a Lua file with name <code>mymodule1.lua</code>
of the form:</p>

<pre><code>-- file mymodule1.lua
require "mymodule"
mymodule._H = { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>To load <code>mymodule</code> we must use:</p>

<pre><code>require "mymodule1"
</code></pre>

<p>and we have available the functions <code>mymodule.&lt;function&gt;</code>,
and also the help <code>mymodule._H</code>, since this moment.</p>

<p>Another third possibility is to utilize the same name,
using the fact that Lua
first looks for source files in <code>LUA_PATH</code> and then binary ones in
<code>LUA_CPATH</code>. Then, we would create a file <code>mymodule.lua</code> in some place
in <code>LUA_PATH</code>, in the way:</p>

<pre><code>-- file mymodule.lua
module(..., package.seeall)

local p = package.path
package.path = ""
package.loaded["mymodule"] = nil

require"mymodule"
package.path = p

mymodule._H = [[ ... help ... ]]
</code></pre>

<p>In this way we can still use:</p>

<pre><code>require "mymodule"
</code></pre>

<p>as before, but now with included help.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this third system might fail if the binary module <code>mymodule.so</code>
(or <code>mymodule.dll</code>) loads in turn modules in Lua source code because
during its load the search in <code>package.path</code> is deactivated.</p>


<h3><span id="know">4.3 How we know that a module has help</span></h3>


<p>At the end of the Lua file containing the module it is possible to
include the following chunk of code to detect if Lua has been launched
in interactive mode:</p>

<pre><code>-- checks if Lua calling was interactive;
-- it does not work in all cases, but it does in the normal ones
local interactive = true
if _G.arg then
   for _, v in pairs(_G.arg) do
     interactive = false
     if v == "-i" then
       interactive = true
       break
     end
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This system of detection does not always work well (and it allows to
generate the <code>html</code> documentation with a simple line in the
operating system shell; we will see it in the following
section).</p>

<p>It would be interesting that in interactive mode the Lua interpreter
creates a variable indicating it. Or at least it could use the existent
variable <code>_PROMPT</code> for it: at present, it is created only if the user
defines it at interpreter launch time, otherwise it is <code>nil</code>.
It would be enough to define <code>_PROMPT</code> in interactive mode to be
<code>"&gt;"</code> if the user did not declare another value, and leave it <code>nil</code>
in non-interactive mode.</p>

<p>After detecting interactivity we have the following chunk:</p>

<pre><code>if interactive then
   -- reusing interactive
   interactive = pcall(require, "ask")                          --**
   if interactive then
      io.stderr:write('Module "mininum" loaded. ')
      io.stderr:write('To obtain help invoke ask"mininum".\n')  --**
      io.stderr:write('Documentation occupies memory. ')
      io.stderr:write('For freeing it let execute:\n')
      io.stderr:write('\n    mininum._H = nil\n\n')

      ask.base"mininum"
   else
      io.stderr:write('Module "mininum" loaded. It has help\n')
      io.stderr:write('but module "ask" is not accesible.\n')   --**
      io.stderr:write('Help removed.\n')
   end
end

if not interactive then
   -- deleting _H
   _H = nil
   _G.ask = nil
   collectgarbage()
end
</code></pre>

<p>This frees not necessary memory in non-interactive mode, and in
addition it shows on screen some messages in interactive mode.</p>

<p>If we want to change the name of <code>ask.lua</code> to another one we will have
also to change the lines indicated by <code>--**</code> above in a similar way.</p>

<p>Apart from this, in the future there is possible the inclusion of an
external utility to adapt the format that accompanies <a href="http://luadoc.luaforge.net">Luadoc</a> (and
also the one that accompanies <a href="http://code.google.com/p/luahelp/downloads/list">LuaHelp</a>) for its use in the module
<code>ask</code>. This allows to depart not from void for modules whose documentation
was already prepared in another way.</p>


<h2><span id="howto">5 How to use the help interactively</span></h2>

<p>As before we have exposed, a module that takes help will have to show when
loaded with <code>require</code> in order to the user knows that help is available.</p>

<p>The last loaded module that holds help will change <code>basis</code> to the name
of the module. The user will have to bear in mind this fact. Anyhow, at
any time the user will be able to change <code>basis</code> or he/she will be punctually
able to use the system with the complete path (that begins with <code>"/"</code>).</p>

<p>If one wants to delete the help from memory it is easy.
Let's suppose that we have the module <code>mininum</code> loaded with:</p>

<pre><code>require "mininum"
</code></pre>

<p>then, it is enough to type:</p>

<pre><code>mininum._H = nil   -- repeat this with each module
collectgarbage()
</code></pre>

<p>After that, if we want to completely delete the help system, we will
write:</p>

<pre><code>_G.ask = nil
collectgarbage()
</code></pre>

<p>From this moment on, the memory is freed of the helping system and the
help information of module <code>mininum</code> (although, obviously its functions
are still loaded).</p>


<h2>6 How <code>html</code> (and PDF) documentation is generated</h2>

<p>In this type of documents it is important to indicate the set of
characters used in the help. At these moments I use <code>iso-8859-15</code> and
therefore, in the help the field is included:</p>

<pre><code>_H._CHARSET = "iso-8859-15"  -- "utf-8" sometimes
</code></pre>

<p>If one want to use <code>utf-8</code> (more current these days) it is necessary
to change it in identical way. If not done so, some characters as "ü",
"ñ", "á", will appear incorrectly. Normally, as we present modules help
in English, people names and similar are usually the only words affected
by this matter.</p>

<p>A very simple way to obtain the documentation in <code>html</code> format would be
the following one in interactive mode:</p>

<pre><code>$ lua
&gt; require "mininum"
&gt; ask.doc""
</code></pre>

<p>This would create <code>mininum.html</code>. Nevertheless, due to a small problem in
the detection of the interactivity (see the following section), the same
documentation can be also obtained by means of:</p>

<pre><code>lua -e "require'mininum'; ask.doc''"
</code></pre>

<p>Once file <code>mininum.html</code> is created it is possible to visualize it
with a browser to consult the help. The given style sheet <code>default.css</code>
places at the left part of the page a fixed menu with the links of the
whole document, including the list of functions inside the module.</p>

<p>The style of the <code>html</code> output is customizable, through a style sheet
with name <code>default.css</code> (hardcoded inside <code>ask.lua</code>). I recomend to
do it only with knowledge of CSS, but it does not hurt to play with it.</p>

<p>When a lot of functions exist in the module it is possible that some links
disappear at the bottom of the screen.  In this case it is necessary
to diminish the font size (or to visualize the document without style,
though ugly, it is still operative). Occasionally the font size should
be diminished to see the examples (the lines do not wrap in the <code>html</code>
elements of type <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>; the examples are converted to <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> elements).</p>

<p>Apart from viewing the <code>html</code> document it is also possible to
print it, in the browser (not advisable) or with a
specific program. We recommend the use of <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html">html2ps</a>,
which converts <code>html</code> in PS, with a style sheet a bit simplified
(see the documentation provided in the link). In this case, the menu of
navigation is not printed.</p>

<p>Later, if wished, we can convert the PS file into PDF by means
of <code>ps2pdf</code> that accompanies <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a>. This method keeps
the links, and we can navigate also in the PDF file.</p>


<h2>7 Weaknesses and possible improvements</h2>

<p>Firstly, due to the fact that we modify some tables (internal ones in
the module that is been modified) it is possible that some collateral
effects appear (which I have still not discovered).</p>

<p>On the other hand, a module can be loaded in a local variable, v.g.,
in the way:</p>

<pre><code>local m = require"mininum"
</code></pre>

<p>to use <code>"m."</code> as prefix for the functions of <code>mininum</code> and to write less.
From this moment it is possible to access the help with <code>mininum</code> and with
<code>m</code>. This does not matter very much in interactive mode (as it is possible to
access the functions with <code>m.fun</code> and with <code>mininum.fun</code>).</p>

<p>Nonetheless, <code>ask.doc"m"</code> creates a file <code>mininum.html</code> with the correct name
(and not with the name <code>m.html</code>).</p>

<p>Functions in the module that are going to have help must not begin
with <code>"_"</code> since <code>ask</code> supposes they are a part of
its system. We can begin a function with <code>"_"</code> but it cannot have help.</p>

<p>Sometimes the interactivity does not work well. For example:</p>

<pre><code>lua -e "require'mininum'" somefile.lua
</code></pre>

<p>shows an initial message and in addition it does not erase the help. Then,
when it executes <code>somefile.lua</code> the help tables are in memory (what can
be counter-productive).</p>

<p>Nevertheless it does not matter too much, because it is enough to
include:</p>

<pre><code>require"mininum"
</code></pre>

<p>at the beginning of <code>somefile.lua</code>, to invoke <code>lua</code> without the
option <code>-e</code>, and then the module unloads <code>ask</code> and the help of
<code>mininum</code> (as soon as it detects that the mode is non-interactive)
before executing the rest of the program.</p>

<p>In interactive mode, in the future it is possible to include <code>http</code> links
for more complete help (for example for a description of an algorithm
or to give a link to a scientific article), or to verify if there are new
versions of a given module. When some of these links appear
a browser might be started when the user was asking for help of this type
(there would be necessary to include a new type, v.g., <code>link</code> with
<code>k</code> as abbreviation).</p>

<p>Tests could also be added (for every function in the module; partly they
might be the executable examples). For example, two fields would
be included: <code>_test</code> with code and <code>_testsolution</code> with text.
On having executed the first one it should obtain the second one
(the module <code>ask</code> would verify that they are equal).  I do not know if
this is interesting. There would be necessary to study it more deeply.</p>

<p>The system as presented here neither is closed nor is the definitive
solution. It can have much improvement. The author wishes this version
of the module can serve as an incentive for other programmers think about
the topic and develop even better systems (or complete this).</p>


<h2>8 Conclusions</h2>

<p>We have designed an interesting system to provide help for
other modules. This is versatile, and it allows on line
access, <code>html</code> doc generation for its review in a browser,
and printed format (PS and PDF).</p>

<p>This system is not perfect, but operative. The author believes
that it can be the seed of a more complete help system
for Lua. The advanced programmers can do the modifications
they wish for their personal use. Actually, <code>AskLua</code> is released
in the public domain. It is awaiting improvements.</p>
